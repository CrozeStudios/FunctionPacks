# FunctionPacks
Adds function packs with argument feature to the PocketMine-MP

# What it does?

- It lets you run multiple commands with arguments!

# Usage

Create file in `functions` directory in your server folder.

Open it and type some commands!

Example:
```
say Hi! I am %player and i typed %0 while using this command! Also i used %1 after that!
say If i repeat i used %0 and %1 and maybe more!
```

NOTE: If you don't type anything for arguments it will be still %0 so will not be changed to something!

# TODO

- Maybe adding jsons to add settings for functions such as needed arguments / permissions etc.
